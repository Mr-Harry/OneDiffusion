# Prompt Guide

All examples are generated with a CFG of $4.2$, $50$ steps, and are non-cherrypicked unless otherwise stated. Negative prompt is set to:
```
monochrome, greyscale, low-res, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name, poorly drawn, bad anatomy, wrong anatomy, extra limb, missing limb, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, mutation, mutated, ugly, disgusting, blurry, amputation
```

## 1. Text-to-Image

### 1.1 Long and detailed prompts give (much) better results.

Since our training comprised of long and detailed prompts, the model is more likely to generate better images with .


The model shows good text adherence with long and complex prompts as in below images. We use the first $20$ prompts from [simoryu's examples](https://cloneofsimo.github.io/compare_aura_sd3/). For detailed prompts, results of other models, refer to the above link.

### 1.2 Resolution

The model generally works well with height and width in range of $[768; 1280]$ (height/width must be divisible by 16) for text-to-image. For other tasks, it performs best with resolution around $512$. 

## 2. ID Customization & Subject-driven generation

- The expected length of source captions is $50$ to $100$ words. Empirically, we find that longer prompt can help preserve the ID better but it might hinder the text-adherence for target caption.

- We find it better to add some descriptions (e.g., from source caption) to target to preserve the identity, especially for complex subjects with delicate details.
